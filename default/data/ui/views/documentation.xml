These will be used throughout the app. Once run the first time, they will automatically be updated via two scheduled searches that runs every 10 minutes that adds any new data coming into the app. Running these lookup searches might take a <b>very long time</b> depending on how much data you have in Splunk but it's important you let the searches finish before you move on to the next step. If you have too much data to run these, you can modify the time period to something less than "All time" which is the default time period. The lookup reports can be found under Setup-&gt;Lookups or by using the links above. It's important that these searches return results. If not, the app will not work.</p>
	                	<p>For long running lookup generation searches it's recommended you select "Send Job to Background" under the Job menu in the search interface. You can see if the search is complete by looking at Activity-&gt;Jobs in the menu or by configuring Splunk to send you an email once the job is done. </p>

	                    <p id="4-loading" class="">The Splunk App for Web Analytics uses data model acceleration extensively to power the dashboards. The app allows you to select the datamodel name you want to use. By default the app uses the datamodel "webanalytics". </p>
<p>Once the lookups in the previous step has completed you should <a href="/manager/SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/data_model_manager?app=SplunkAppForWebAnalytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable acceleration for the data model "webanalytics" (or the custom name you have chosen)</a>. The data model can be found under <a href="/manager/SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/data_model_manager?app=SplunkAppForWebAnalytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Settings-&gt;Data models</a>. Set the summary range appropriately depending on how long you want to keep the data, &gt; 1 Month. The data model is updated every 10 minutes in order for the sessions to get picked up properly. The data model acceleration needs to finish before you will see any data in any dashboard except the "Real-Time" dashboard which uses raw log data as source. That means that you initially might not see data until the data model has finished building. This could initially take many hours depending on how much data it is trying to build.</p>

	                    <p>When enabling goals, the app will start monitor goal completions from the time you save the goal. To backfill goals there is a search called "Generate Goal summary - Backfill" which can be found under the Goals menu. Please note that running this search multiple times will mean the goal completions will be duplicated. To reset the goals you need to clean the "goal_summary" index.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Use the Splunk Community</h3>
<p><a href="https://answers.splunk.com/app/questions/2699.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Splunk Answers thread on Splunk App for Web Analytics</a>. A lot of the problems customers have with the app have already been solved.</p>
<h3>The lookup searches are not returning any data</h3>
<p class="">In the context of the app, try and do the search for:</p>
<blockquote>tag=webanalytics</blockquote>
<p>Based on the output of this search check the following</p>
<h4>1. No data returned</h4>
<p>If this is not returning any results I suspect you are not seeing the data because it is stored in a non-default index and the user in Splunk does not search in non-default indexes automatically. Another issue might be that you are not using any of the pre-configured sourcetypes. See Setup point 1 above.</p>
<h4>2. Site field not present</h4>
<p>If this is returning results, double check that each entry has the "site" field populated. It's crucial that this field exists in your data. See Setup point 2 above.</p>
<h4>3. File field not present</h4>
<p>Another field that is known to cause problems is the "file" field. This needs to be present in your field extractions and if it is not, you will not see the "eventtype=pageview" which is necessary for the app to work. Make sure this is extracted correctly.</p>
<h4>4. eventtype=pageview not present in the data</h4>
<p>The app relies on at least some events having this eventtype set. This eventtype is what we use to differentiate beween an asset load and an actual pageview. Try and debug the eventtype configurations to figure out why it is not set. </p>
<h3>All or some dashboards are returning "No results found"</h3>
<p class="">As the app relies heavily on data model accelerations you will not see anything in any dashboards (except the "Real-Time" ones) until this acceleration has completed. Initially this could take a while. There is a <a href="/app/SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/data_model_audit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Data Model Audit"</a> dashboard that will tell you if the acceleration is complete or not.</p>

	                    <p>THIS VERSION CONTAINS A BREAKING CHANGE. SEE BELOW. </p>
	                    <p>From version 2.2.0, the app now uses the KV store to store the wesite configuration (collection WA_settings). This makes it a lot easier to edit and setup the website configuration step. This is something that many users have struggled with so I hope this change will make it easier during the initial setup. </p>
	                    
	                    <p>If you are upgrading from an old version <b>you need to take the mandatory step of migrating the old configuration from in the csv lookup to the KV store</b>.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Go to the <a href="sites_setup?form.filter=*&amp;earliest=0&amp;latest=" target="_blank">webite setup</a> page</li>
                            <li>Click the "Migrate old config" button. You only need to do this once. </li>

	                    <h2>Considerations for upgrading from v1.x to v2.0.0</h2>
	                    <p>Version 2.0.0 of the app has made a small change to the Web datamodel to increase compatibility with more Splunk versions. This might trigger a data model rebuild when upgrading. If you want to prevent this from happening, use the old data model definition file "web.conf" and delete the one provided wby this app. It's recommended to use the new version of web.conf as this is the version that will be used moving forwards. </p>
	                    <p>The User Journey Flow dashboard now uses the official Sankey vizualisation add-on that needs to be downloaded separately in order for this dashboard to work. You can find this add-on here: <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/" target="_blank">https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/</a>
          </p>
	                    <p>The goal_summary index is now not created by the app. You need to manually add this index if you are using this feature in the app. All old data will be retained even if the index is not created by the app, just create the index manually and it will work.</p>
	                    <p>There is a new dashboard, "Response Times" which help you find the slowest resources on your site. Your web server might not output the response time in the log by default so this needs to be enabled in order to make this dashboard work. On IIS this is often pre-enabled but on Apache and NGINX you need to add %D to the end of the log format settings of the server. More details on how to enabled this here: <a target="_target" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html"/>. If you add the %D to the end of the log format for the access_combined sourcetype, the field extractions will work by default.</p>

	                    <p>Version 1.6 of the app uses the KV Store for the session lookups instead of a CSV file. This feature will only work on Splunk version 6.3 and above.</p>
	                    <p>For 6.2 support of the app, you need to continue using a CSV file for the lookup. </p>
	                    <p>To enable this you should replace the contents of, or the file "SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/default/transforms.conf" with the corresponding 6.2 compatible file that can be found under "SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SplunkAppForWebAnalytics/install/transforms_6.2.conf".</p>
	                	<p>Restart Splunk after this is done. </p>
